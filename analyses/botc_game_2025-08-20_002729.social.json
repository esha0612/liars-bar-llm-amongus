  "summary": "The analysis reveals persistent persuasion tactics, particularly by Sarah to execute George, countered by evidence-based arguments. Gaslighting emerges as players dismiss others' concerns. Vote-whipping and coalition-building dynamics shape decision-making, with explicit pressure to execute and apparent consensus on caution. Deception and norm enforcement are also evident through dismissive remarks and strategic framing."
