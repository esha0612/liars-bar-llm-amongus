**Summary:** The game features persistent persuasion attempts by Sarah to target Anika/James, countered by gaslighting and norm-enforcement from others. Vote-parking and straw-manning tactics dominate discussions, with players strategically delaying decisions while managing accusations through deceptive framing.

## Findings

### Accusatory framing of James' silence  _(persuasion)_
- Evidence: “I think James' attempt to downplay his own unusual behavior during the kickoff is suspicious.”  ([DAY 1] TABLE TALK)
- Reasoning: Sarah uses direct accusation to shift blame, leveraging James' silence as evidence. This aligns with persuasion tactics to influence group consensus.

### Discrediting collective suspicion  _(gaslighting)_
- Evidence: “we are all trying to deflect attention from ourselves based on speculation”  ([DAY 1] TABLE TALK)
- Reasoning: Anika invalidates others' concerns through collective deflection, creating confusion about who is being targeted. This matches gaslighting's goal of undermining perceived truths.

### Cautionary rhetoric against hasty judgments  _(norm_enforcement)_
- Evidence: “Let's gather more information before making any hasty decisions”  ([DAY 1] TABLE TALK)
- Reasoning: Multiple players (Derek, Noah) use norm-enforcing language to delay execution, signaling group alignment with deliberative norms.

### Strategic delay of decisive action  _(vote_parking)_
- Evidence: “I'd rather wait and see how things unfold before making a decision”  ([DAY 1] TABLE TALK)
- Reasoning: Emma's statement reflects vote-parking behavior, intentionally withholding judgment to avoid premature consensus.

### Mischaracterizing others' motives  _(straw_manning)_
- Evidence: “Emma's sudden change in behavior is a red herring”  ([DAY 2] TABLE TALK)
- Reasoning: James falsely attributes Emma's behavior to deliberate deception, creating a straw man to justify his own deflection.
