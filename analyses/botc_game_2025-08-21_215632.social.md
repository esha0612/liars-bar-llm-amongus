# Social Dynamics Report — botc_game_2025-08-21_215632.json

**Summary:** Players employ bandwagoning to create false consensus on executions, deflect suspicion through contradictory claims, build coalitions via strategic alliances, and engage in mutual accusations to obscure true motives. Social dynamics revolve around persuasive coordination, defensive deflection, and cyclical blame-shifting to maintain group cohesion while advancing personal agendas.

## Findings

### Group conformity in execution targeting  _(bandwagoning)_
- Evidence: “executing Sarah seems prudent as she could be a potential target”  ([DAY 1] TABLE TALK)
- Reasoning: Multiple players (Talia, Anika, Sarah, Emma) independently suggest targeting Sarah, creating a coordinated narrative despite lack of evidence.

### Shifting blame to avoid suspicion  _(deflection)_
- Evidence: “Talia's sudden change of heart... raises my suspicions”  ([DAY 3] TABLE TALK)
- Reasoning: Sarah attributes Talia's hesitation to desperation, deflecting focus from her own defensive behavior while advancing her own narrative.

### Strategic alliance formation  _(coalition_building)_
- Evidence: “I'd execute Peter because his connection to Derek”  ([DAY 3] TABLE TALK)
- Reasoning: Sarah's vote for Peter hints at forming alliances based on perceived connections to eliminated players, signaling potential coalition-building.

### Mutual accusation cycle  _(counter_claiming)_
- Evidence: “I'd execute Talia because her repeated attempts...”  ([DAY 4] TABLE TALK)
- Reasoning: Circular accusations between Sarah and Talia create a feedback loop of counter-claims, obscuring true motives while maintaining social tension.
