  "summary": "Anika was the primary suspect due to her proximity to Emma's death and evasive behavior. James and Christian were secondary suspects due to their evasiveness and suspicious actions. The analysis concludes that Anika's elimination and her death being labeled a smokescreen suggest she may have been the Imp, though James's evasiveness complicates the conclusion."
