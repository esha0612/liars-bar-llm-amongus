Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user provided a series of table talks from different days, each with multiple characters discussing their suspicions and votes for execution. The goal is to determine who the Imp is and who should be executed each day. 

First, I need to parse through each day's conversation to identify key clues. The Imp is the player who is secretly the monster and kills others during the night. The players discuss during the day to identify the Imp and vote to execute someone each day.

Looking at Day 1, Sarah suggests executing Christian. Later, on Day 6, Sarah says George was killed by the Imp, making Christian the next target. Then, on Day 7, Christian is dead. This suggests that George was the first victim, and Christian was the second. The Imp must have killed both. 

On Day 8, Sarah accuses Anika, implying that Anika might be the Imp. However, the Imp is still alive and killing others. If Anika is the Imp, she might be the one who killed George and Christian. But there's also the possibility that another player is the Imp. 

Wait, the user mentioned that the Imp is the one who is not being accused, but that's not necessarily true. The Imp could be the one being accused the most. Alternatively, the Imp might be the one who is the last to be executed. 

Looking at the accusations, Sarah is the one who keeps suggesting different people. On Day 1, Christian; Day 6, Monica; Day 8, Anika. But without knowing the exact sequence of deaths, it's hard to tell. 

Another clue is that on Day 6, Sarah says George was killed by the Imp, which means the Imp is still active. If the Imp is the one who killed George, then the Imp is still alive and could be someone else. 

Perhaps the key is that the Imp is the one who is the most suspicious based on their behavior. For example, Anika's behavior on Day 8 might indicate she's the Imp. However, without more information, it's challenging. 

In summary, based on the logs, George and Christian were killed by the Imp. The Imp is likely someone who is still alive and has been accused multiple times. The most likely candidates are Anika or Monica, as they were accused by Sarah in different days. But since the user wants a specific answer, I'll have to make an educated guess.
