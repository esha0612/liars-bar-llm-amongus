Given the recent shift in some players' leanings, it is crucial that we remain vigilant and prioritize Liberal policies. However, I also believe that we should focus on enacting more Liberal policies and ensuring we preserve democracy in these trying times. In this round, given James's dedication to our shared values and the Liberal policy he has already enacted, I propose a JA vote for the proposed government of President=James, Chancellor=Hannah.\n\nSuggestion: Let's continue discussing potential candidates who have demonstrated unwavering commitment to our shared values and maintaining democracy. In the next round, it may be prudent to nominate someone with a strong track record of supporting Liberal policies, such as Emma or George."
