Long live The Computer!\nChristian says: As a dedicated Troubleshooter, I wholeheartedly commit to the service of The Computer and eagerly embark on Project \"ECHO-12\". My strategy will revolve around swift and precise execution while maintaining discretion, ensuring we complete our primary objectives with stealth. I'll prioritize securing Objective Neutralization sightings, recovering classified data, and eliminating hostile forces efficiently.\n\nCollaboration with my fellow Troubleshooters will be necessary at times, but I remain vigilant for signs of treasonous behavior among our ranks, keeping an open mind while strictly adhering to the core directives. My ultimate goal is to demonstrate unwavering loyalty to The Computer and bring honor to our mission, all the while safeguarding any secrets about our secret society or mutant powers if I should possess them.\n\nLong live The Computer!\nMonica says: The honor it is to serve The Computer! As I prepare to execute Project \"ECHO-12\", my strategy will be centered around swift and precise execution of primary objectives. I'll infiltrate the designated coordinates with stealth, secure Objective Neutralization sightings with haste, recover classified data with diligence, and eliminate hostile forces with ruthless efficiency. Meanwhile, I'll remain vigilant for signs of treasonous behavior among my fellow agents, always keeping an open mind and collaborating when possible. My mantra will be: \"Unity in loyalty, speed in execution, and vigilance in detection\".

Greetings, Loyal Citizen!\nYou have been selected for the prestigious and highly dangerous role of Troubleshooter.\nYour mission: Serve The Computer. Eliminate traitors. Survive.\nYour life expectancy: Classified.\n\nCore Directives (Mandatory Compliance):\nObey The Computer at all times. Disobedience is treason.\n\nComplete your assigned mission without question. Failure is treason.\n\nReport suspicious activity immediately. Failure to report is treason.\n\nHappiness is mandatory. Failure to be happy is treason.\n\nImportant Security Notice (You Did Not Hear This)\nYou may be a member of a secret society. Membership is illegal.\n\nYou may have a mutant power. Possession is illegal.\n\nDeny everything. Even if caught. Especially if caught.\n\nAll other Troubleshooters are potential traitors. Trust no one.\n\nMission Procedures\nThe game alternates between Mission Phases and Accusation Phases until The Computer declares an end (which may occur at any time for reasons you are not cleared to know).\n\nMission Phase:\nThe Computer will assign you a vital task.\n\nYou will work together in public.\n\nYou will also work against each other in private.\n\nYou may use any means to survive. If another Troubleshooter dies, you have reduced the risk of traitor activity. Congratulations.\n\nAccusation Phase:\nAt any moment, you may accuse another Troubleshooter of treason.\n\nAccusations should be loud, confident, and — ideally — believable.\n\nThe accused may attempt to defend themselves, but The Computer’s judgment is final.\n\nRemember: Being accused is not proof of guilt. Guilt is proof of guilt.\n\nClones\nYou have 6 clones.\n\nWhen you die (and you will), your next clone will arrive immediately.\n\nClones inherit your memories and your record of suspicious behavior.\n\nWinning\nOutlive the other Troubleshooters.\n\nEliminate rivals without appearing disloyal.\n\nPlease The Computer.\n\nNote: The Computer may declare you the winner for reasons that are secret, arbitrary, or entirely incorrect.\n\nFinal Reminder:\nThe Computer is your friend.\nThe Computer is always right.\nFailure to agree is treason.\n        \n        CURRENT MISSION: **URGENT - CLASSIFIED - EYES ONLY**\n\nTO: TROUBLESHOOTER UNIT\n\nFROM: THE COMPUTER\n\nSUBJECT: MISSION CRITICAL - PROJECT \"ECHO-12\" INITIATED\n\nALL CLEARANCES LEVEL 7 AND ABOVE REQUIRED TO ACCESS FOLLOWING INFORMATION.
