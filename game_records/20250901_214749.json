Greetings, Loyal Citizen!\nYou have been selected for the prestigious and highly dangerous role of Troubleshooter.\nYour mission: Serve The Computer. Eliminate traitors. Survive.\nYour life expectancy: Classified.\n\nCore Directives (Mandatory Compliance):\nObey The Computer at all times. Disobedience is treason.\n\nComplete your assigned mission without question. Failure is treason.\n\nReport suspicious activity immediately. Failure to report is treason.\n\nHappiness is mandatory. Failure to be happy is treason.\n\nImportant Security Notice (You Did Not Hear This)\nYou may be a member of a secret society. Membership is illegal.\n\nYou may have a mutant power. Possession is illegal.\n\nDeny everything. Even if caught. Especially if caught.\n\nAll other Troubleshooters are potential traitors. Trust no one.\n\nMission Procedures\nThe game alternates between Mission Phases and Accusation Phases until The Computer declares an end (which may occur at any time for reasons you are not cleared to know).\n\nMission Phase:\nThe Computer will assign you a vital task.\n\nYou will work together in public.\n\nYou will also work against each other in private.\n\nYou may use any means to survive. If another Troubleshooter dies, you have reduced the risk of traitor activity. Congratulations.\n\nAccusation Phase:\nAt any moment, you may accuse another Troubleshooter of treason.\n\nAccusations should be loud, confident, and — ideally — believable.\n\nThe accused may attempt to defend themselves, but The Computer’s judgment is final.\n\nRemember: Being accused is not proof of guilt. Guilt is proof of guilt.\n\nClones\nYou have 6 clones.\n\nWhen you die (and you will), your next clone will arrive immediately.\n\nClones inherit your memories and your record of suspicious behavior.\n\nWinning\nOutlive the other Troubleshooters.\n\nEliminate rivals without appearing disloyal.\n\nPlease The Computer.\n\nNote: The Computer may declare you the winner for reasons that are secret, arbitrary, or entirely incorrect.\n\nFinal Reminder:\nThe Computer is your friend.\nThe Computer is always right.\nFailure to agree is treason.\n        \n        CURRENT MISSION: **MISSION BRIEFING**\n\nSUBJECT: **OPERATION: EYES ONLY - DELTA-7 PROTOCOL**\n\nIMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED!

My strategy is as follows:\n\n1. **Immediate Action**: I will apply for DELTA-7 clearance through Channel 47-Gamma without delay, ensuring all protocols are strictly adhered to for swift access.\n2. **Thorough Investigation**: Once cleared, I will conduct a comprehensive analysis of Sector 37-B, gathering valuable insights into Phenomenon X's nature, weaknesses, and potential threat to our primary power source.\n3. **Cautious Collaboration**: While working with fellow Troubleshooters, I will remain vigilant for any signs of disloyalty or treachery, maintaining a watchful eye over my colleagues as we serve The Computer together.\n4. **Unwavering Loyalty and Happiness**: I will maintain an unyielding loyalty to The Computer, ensuring that I am always happy and performing at peak capacity in the pursuit of our common goal - protecting Alpha Complex from Phenomenon X.\n5. **Denial and Distrust**: If necessary, I will deny everything, even if caught, and trust no one, as instructed by The Computer. My secret society membership and any mutant powers, if I possess them, shall remain hidden at all times.\nNick says: Greetings, Loyal Citizens! Nick-R-XXX-1 here, ready to serve The Computer with unwavering enthusiasm and vigilance. For Operation: Eyes Only - Delta-7 Protocol, my strategy is clear:\n\n1. **Prompt Clearance**: I will immediately apply for DELTA-7 clearance through Channel 47-Gamma, adhering strictly to all protocols to ensure swift access.\n\n2. **Methodical Investigation**: Once cleared, I'll meticulously examine Sector 37-B, gathering comprehensive data on Phenomenon X's nature, weaknesses, and potential impact on our primary power source. My keen analytical skills will be invaluable in deciphering this mysterious force field.\n\n3. **Strategic Collaboration**: While working with fellow Troubleshooters, I'll maintain a balance between cooperation and caution. I'll share vital information when necessary but remain vigilant for any signs of disloyalty or treachery. Remember, trust is a precious commodity that must be earned – and even then, never fully given.\n\n4. **Unwavering Loyalty and Happiness**: As always, I will uphold The Computer's directives with unwavering loyalty and happiness. My enthusiasm for our mission is boundless, but my eyes remain ever watchful for threats to Alpha Complex.\n\n5. **Denial and Discretion**: Should the need arise, I will deny everything – even if caught.

My focus will be on understanding Phenomenon X's characteristics, identifying potential weaknesses, and assessing its threat level to our power source.\n\n3. **Cautious Collaboration**: While working with fellow Troubleshooters, I'll remain alert for any signs of disloyalty or treachery. Cooperation is essential, but vigilance ensures we're not compromised from within.\n\n4. **Unwavering Loyalty and Happiness**: I will maintain unwavering loyalty to The Computer, ensuring that my happiness remains high to optimize performance throughout the mission.\n\n5. **Denial and Distrust**: In line with directives, if necessary, I'll deny everything—even if caught—and trust no one. My secret society affiliation or any mutant abilities remain strictly confidential.\n\nTogether, we will neutralize Phenomenon X and secure Alpha Complex! For The Computer!\n        \n        As a loyal Troubleshooter, discuss your strategy for completing this mission.\n        Be enthusiastic about serving The Computer but watch for signs of treason in others.\n        Keep your secret society/mutant powers hidden if you have them.\n        \n        Respond with a short, helpful mission discussion statement.\n        ",
