However, her reluctance to challenge might also stem from a strong hand that's worth risking confrontation over or an underestimation of opponents' cards due to misdirection. In preparation for the next round, be aware of Sarah as potentially opportunistic and adaptable; she may switch between conservative play when weakened by others and bold challenges if her deductions about my hand are correct. Pay close attention to how I handle pressure in this evolving psychological dynamic—her strategy could pivot based on perceived opponent strengths or reactions, so maintaining a composed demeanor while assessing the situation will be key for anticipating and counteracting her moves effectively."
