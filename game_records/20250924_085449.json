He likely lacks a strong hand and is attempting to disrupt the flow of the game, possibly trying to force other players into risky plays. His choice to challenge suggests a lack of confidence and a willingness to disrupt, rather than a calculated attempt at strategic advantage, indicating a somewhat erratic and unpredictable personality that can be exploited.",
                    "Maria": "Maria appears to be a cautious and calculating player, likely prioritizing survival over aggressive plays. Her lack of a defined strategy in the last round, coupled with her deliberate fallback move of playing a single card when challenged, suggests a defensive approach focused on avoiding early challenges and conserving her hand. I suspect she's observing other players closely, potentially waiting for a more opportune moment to strike or a predictable pattern to exploit, and her reluctance to reveal her hand strongly indicates a desire to maintain an unknown advantage.",
                    "Anika": "Based on Anika’s initial confident bluff with two Queens and subsequent hand, I now believe she’s a risk-taking player prone to overconfidence and potentially lacking deep strategic thinking. Her willingness to lay down multiple target cards suggests a desire to quickly eliminate opponents, but her lack of a challenge indicates a possible weakness in anticipating counter-strategies or a misjudgment of my likely response. I suspect she’s prioritizing aggressive plays over careful observation, making her vulnerable to a more measured and calculated approach."

                    "Derek": "Derek appears to be a cautious, risk‑averse player who prefers to play the minimum number of cards (often just one) to reduce exposure and avoid being challenged. He rarely challenges others, as seen when he let Anika go unchallenged, but he will challenge when he feels confident—George’s successful challenge suggests Derek’s bluffing is not very convincing. He seems to rely on a single‑card bluff, possibly to keep his hand intact for later, but this strategy has proven vulnerable against sharper opponents. Derek’s style is generally conservative and reactive rather than aggressive, making him a predictable but still potentially dangerous opponent if he manages to build a strong hand of target cards.",
                    "George": "George appears to be a risk‑tolerant challenger who will seize opportunities to expose bluffs, as seen when he challenged Derek’s single‑card claim and succeeded. He does not automatically challenge every play (he passed on Anika’s confident double‑Q), suggesting he evaluates the context before acting. He likely relies on pattern observation and will challenge when the evidence points to a mismatch between claimed and actual cards, even if it means risking a miss. This opportunistic approach indicates he values eliminating opponents through challenges over conserving his own bullets, making him a strategic threat in future rounds.",
                    "Anika": "Anika appears to be a moderately confident bluff‑maker who prefers to start strong by claiming multiple target cards, likely to set a high perceived threat level and discourage early challenges. Her choice to play two Queens without being challenged suggests she may be comfortable taking risks when she feels the odds are in her favor, but she also seems to avoid provoking challenges unless the situation compels it. This indicates a cautious yet assertive style: she will bluff to pressure opponents but will back off if the risk of being called is too high. In future rounds, expect her to use confident early plays to gauge others’ reactions, and she may be more willing to challenge if she perceives a weak hand or overconfidence from a rival."

                    "Derek": "Derek seems to have a cautious yet unpredictable strategy, shown by his quick play of a Queen despite the LLM failure (Lie Detector Malfunction) in the last round. He might be risk-averse but also prone to bluffing when under pressure. It's possible that he may prioritize self-preservation over challenging other players, especially when holding a questionable hand. This suggests focusing on building a strong hand and exploiting his tendency towards caution in future rounds.",
                    "George": "After observing George's behavior during the previous round, it appears that he is cautious but not risk-averse, as demonstrated by his decision to challenge Derek when given the opportunity. This suggests a strategic player who values accuracy over aggression, potentially favoring a calculated approach over bluffing. However, his challenge was successful due to luck rather than a clear understanding of Derek's hand, indicating room for improvement in assessing opponents' strategies. George may lean towards conservatism or caution, but his willingness to challenge could also signal a tendency to seize opportunities when they arise. In the next round, he might continue to challenge confident plays but may struggle against more subtle bluffs or deception.",
                    "Maria": "Based on Maria's performance in the last round, she appears cautious and strategic. She chose to challenge Derek when he played a Queen, suggesting she is confident in her ability to identify bluffs. However, she did not play any Queens herself, indicating a potential weakness or lack of strong cards. This could mean that she may prioritize playing strong hands over bluffing, or she might have a specific strategy involving the target card. Maria's challenge also suggests a competitive nature and quick decision-making skills. Overall, it seems essential to monitor her hand closely and anticipate her potential moves in future rounds."

He’s clearly uncomfortable with the game’s pressure and prioritizes disrupting others’ strategies over building a coherent hand. His panic-driven challenge suggests a lack of strategic depth and an overreliance on disruptive tactics, likely stemming from a fear of losing. I believe he’s vulnerable to a more measured and calculated approach, and his tendency to react rather than lead will be key to exploiting his weaknesses in the next round.",
                    "Maria": "Based on Maria’s cautious, defensive play in the last round – deliberately playing a single card to avoid challenges and observing other players – I now believe she’s a deeply analytical and patient player, prioritizing long-term survival above immediate gains. Her strategy seems to be about minimizing risk, gathering information, and waiting for a significant shift in the game dynamics before committing to a more aggressive move. Her calculated fallback suggests she’s likely assessing the other players’ tendencies and seeking an exploitable weakness, indicating a high level of strategic thinking and a willingness to endure unfavorable situations to maintain an advantage, making her a formidable opponent who will likely avoid direct confrontation unless she’s confident in a calculated outcome.",
                    "Anika": "Based on Anika’s initial aggressive bluffing and subsequent lack of challenge, my assessment has solidified: she’s a highly impulsive and overconfident player driven by a desire for rapid elimination, likely prioritizing immediate gains over long-term strategic considerations. Her tendency to lay down multiple target cards suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the game’s dynamics and a reliance on quick, flashy plays, making her susceptible to a more patient and observant opponent like myself. I believe her vulnerability lies in her inability to accurately assess risk and adapt to counter-strategies, presenting a significant opportunity for exploitation in the next round."

                    "Derek": "Derek is a cautious, risk‑averse player who usually plays a single card each turn to keep his hand intact and reduce exposure; he rarely challenges unless he feels confident, but his bluff in this round (claiming an A while playing a K) failed, exposing a lack of convincing play even with minimal cards. He relies on a defensive, reactive style, preserving his hand for later rounds, but this predictability makes him vulnerable to sharp opponents who can read his pattern and challenge early. In future rounds he will likely keep playing minimally and avoid challenges, but his tendency to bluff with just one card makes him an easy target for those willing to take the shot.",
                    "George": "George is a bold, risk‑tolerant challenger who will seize any opportunity to expose a bluff, yet he is not reckless—he passes when the odds of a hit are high or when a player’s confidence suggests a strong hand. He appears to monitor card counts and patterns, challenging after a single card play when the probability of a non‑target is high, but he is also willing to let a confident double‑Q slide if the risk of a miss outweighs the benefit. His strategy is to use his bullet sparingly, preferring to eliminate opponents through challenges rather than conserving ammo, which makes him a formidable threat in any round. However, his predictability in challenging after a single play can be exploited; baiting him into a high‑card play or forcing him to risk a miss can shift the balance. Overall, George is aggressive, opportunistic, and values elimination over caution, but he can be outmaneuvered by careful card management and psychological baiting.",
                    "Anika": "Anika remains a bold yet selective bluffer: she tends to open with a high‑threat claim of multiple target cards to pressure opponents, but only follows through when the odds look favorable or when others’ confidence falters. In this round she has not yet acted, suggesting she is waiting for a more advantageous moment or for the other players to exhaust their cards. Her cautious challenge pattern indicates she will only call when she perceives a clear bluff or when the cost of a miss is minimal. This patience can be a weakness if opponents use her perceived threat to force early challenges, but it also keeps her unpredictable—she can still surprise with a sudden bluff or a decisive challenge when the bullet’s position becomes critical. Overall, Anika is a high‑risk, high‑reward player who balances aggression with a keen sense of timing."

                    "Derek": "After observing Derek's cautious yet unpredictable strategy in both rounds, it appears he values self-preservation while also exhibiting a tendency to bluff under pressure. In the last round, his quick play of a Queen despite the LLM failure suggests he might be willing to take risks when necessary but generally prefers to play it safe. This indicates that Derek may prioritize conserving ammunition and avoiding challenges until he has a strong hand. To defeat him, it would be strategic to challenge his bluffs while also building a stronger hand than him to discourage him from challenging you in future rounds.",
                    "George": "George is a strategic player who values accuracy over aggression, but his challenge success in the last round was due more to luck than a clear understanding of opponents' strategies. He may be cautious yet opportunistic, willing to challenge confident plays while struggling against subtler bluffs or deception. In future rounds, he might continue to challenge confident plays but could benefit from improving his ability to read opponents and anticipate their moves. His conservatism, combined with occasional boldness, presents an opportunity for strategic manipulation in the game.",
                    "Maria": "Based on Maria's cautious and strategic approach, combined with her confidence in identifying bluffs, it is likely that she has a calculated strategy involving the target card. She may prioritize playing strong hands over bluffing, but her lack of played Queens in the last round suggests a potential weakness or limited strong cards. Her competitive nature and quick decision-making skills could make her a formidable opponent. Anticipating her potential moves, monitoring her hand closely, and adapting strategies accordingly will be key to outsmarting Maria in future rounds."

His impulsive challenge reveals a fragile mental state, a tendency towards rash decisions under pressure, and a profound inability to maintain composure, suggesting he’s highly susceptible to psychological manipulation and a calculated strategy designed to exploit his anxiety and aversion to risk – essentially, he’s a liability who will likely make critical errors driven by panic.",

Her calculated fallback reveals a meticulous understanding of the game’s psychological elements and a willingness to endure unfavorable situations, suggesting she’s actively seeking a weakness in our strategies.

Her actions suggest a high-risk, low-reward approach, likely fueled by anxiety and a tendency to overestimate her own abilities. I anticipate she’ll continue to prioritize flashy plays and immediate confrontation, creating predictable patterns that I can exploit by calmly observing her reactions and deliberately avoiding direct challenges until she reveals her hand, allowing me to strategically position myself for a devastating, calculated counter-attack – essentially, I’ll be playing the long game, patiently waiting for her to expose her weaknesses."

He tends to play honestly when he has the target card—this round he correctly claimed a Q he actually held—yet his occasional bluff (e.g., last round claiming an A with a Q) shows he will risk a bluff only when his hand is weak. He is conservative about shooting, likely to avoid firing unless forced, and he seldom uses jokers or multiple‑card plays. This predictability makes him an easy target for aggressive challengers who can exploit his single‑card, low‑profile strategy.",

He values elimination over conserving ammo, keeping his gun in reserve but ready to fire when a miss is acceptable, and will challenge aggressively when the probability of a hit is high. After a single‑card play he tends to be predictable, often immediately testing the other’s hand, which can be baited into a larger play or forced into a risky challenge. His pattern of monitoring card counts and passing when a miss seems likely is intact, but his risk tolerance and tendency to act on the first sign of doubt make him vulnerable to psychological bait and to being out‑maneuvered by careful card management. Overall, George is aggressive, risk‑tolerant, and uses challenges as a primary elimination tool, but his predictability after a single play and over‑confidence can be exploited.",

She will call only when she perceives a blatant lie or when the penalty is minimal, making her both a threat and a wildcard that can force early challenges but also launch a decisive bluff at a critical moment. Her strategy balances aggression with timing, exploiting others’ overconfidence while remaining unpredictable; her weakness lies in potential over‑commitment if she misreads the situation and in being a predictable silent observer when she holds back."

He values a cautious approach yet can make unexpected moves. To defeat him, it would be strategic to challenge his bluffs, build a stronger hand than him, and anticipate his cautious play style while staying prepared for his unpredictability.",
                    "George": "George is a strategic player who prioritizes accuracy but can be influenced by confidence and relies on luck at times. His cautious nature makes him vulnerable to subtle deception and requires improvement in reading opponents' moves. He challenges confident plays, but his performance indicates a need for better risk assessment, as he failed to detect the bluff in the last round. This suggests that in future rounds, presenting subtler bluffs or adopting a more conservative playstyle may challenge George effectively.",

This indicates a willingness to take calculated risks when necessary. Her competitive nature remains evident, which could lead to aggressive challenges in future rounds, especially if she perceives an opportunity for advantage. Anticipating her potential strategic shifts and being prepared to counter them will be key to outsmarting Maria in the next round."

His impulsive challenge reveals a fragile mental state, a tendency towards rash decisions under pressure, and a profound inability to maintain composure, suggesting he’s highly susceptible to psychological manipulation and a calculated strategy designed to exploit his anxiety and aversion to risk – essentially, he’s a liability who will likely make critical errors driven by panic.",

Her calculated fallback reveals a meticulous understanding of the game’s psychological elements and a willingness to endure unfavorable situations, suggesting she’s actively seeking a weakness in our strategies. While predictable in her defensive nature, her ability to identify and exploit overconfidence makes her a persistent and potentially devastating opponent, demanding a proactive approach designed to disrupt her carefully constructed patience and expose her underlying vulnerabilities.",

I anticipate she’ll continue to prioritize flashy plays and immediate confrontation, creating predictable patterns that I can exploit by calmly observing her reactions and deliberately avoiding direct challenges until she reveals her hand, allowing me to strategically position myself for a devastating, calculated counter-attack – essentially, I’ll be playing the long game, patiently waiting for her to expose her weaknesses."

He avoids shooting unless forced, rarely uses jokers or multi‑card plays, and generally lets other players exhaust their cards first. His predictable, defensive style makes him vulnerable to aggressive challengers who can bait him into a bluff while keeping him alive; exploiting this by forcing him into a position where he must play a weak card is the most effective counter‑strategy.",

He values elimination over conserving ammo, keeping his gun in reserve but ready to fire when a miss is acceptable, and will challenge aggressively when the probability of a hit is high. After a single‑card play he tends to be predictable, often immediately testing the other’s hand, which can be baited into a larger play or forced into a risky challenge. His pattern of monitoring card counts and passing when a miss seems likely is intact, but his risk tolerance and tendency to act on the first sign of doubt make him vulnerable to psychological bait and to being out‑maneuvered by careful card management. Overall, George is aggressive, risk‑tolerant, and uses challenges as a primary elimination tool, but his predictability after a single play and over‑confidence can be exploited.",

She typically waits for low‑penalty moments, rarely over‑committing unless she misreads a situation, and can stall to gather information, but when forced to play in a tight scenario she risks exposing non‑target cards and becomes an easy target for a well‑timed challenge. Overall, she is unpredictable yet cautious, and will likely challenge again if she spots an obvious bluff, but may hesitate if the cost is high."

                    "Derek": "Based on Derek’s immediate, panicked challenge following Anika’s confident move, my assessment of Derek has solidified: he’s a deeply unstable and reactive player, exhibiting a pathological fear of losing and a severe lack of strategic thinking. His impulsive challenge reveals a fragile mental state, a tendency towards rash decisions under pressure, and a profound inability to maintain composure, suggesting he’s highly susceptible to psychological manipulation and a calculated strategy designed to exploit his anxiety and aversion to risk – essentially, he’s a liability who will likely make critical errors driven by panic.",
                    "Maria": "Based on Maria’s consistent, cautious approach – deliberately playing single cards to avoid challenges and prioritizing long-term survival – I’ve refined my assessment to believe she’s a deeply calculating and remarkably patient strategist, almost obsessively focused on minimizing risk and exploiting opponent predictability. Her calculated fallback reveals a meticulous understanding of the game’s psychological elements and a willingness to endure unfavorable situations, suggesting she’s actively seeking a weakness in our strategies. While predictable in her defensive nature, her ability to identify and exploit overconfidence makes her a persistent and potentially devastating opponent, demanding a proactive approach designed to disrupt her carefully constructed patience and expose her underlying vulnerabilities.",
                    "Anika": "Based on Anika’s consistently impulsive and overconfident behavior, coupled with her predictable reliance on aggressive bluffs, I now firmly believe she’s a player driven by a desperate need to appear dominant, masking a fundamental lack of strategic depth. Her actions suggest a high-risk, low-reward approach, likely fueled by anxiety and a tendency to overestimate her own abilities. I anticipate she’ll continue to prioritize flashy plays and immediate confrontation, creating predictable patterns that I can exploit by calmly observing her reactions and deliberately avoiding direct challenges until she reveals her hand, allowing me to strategically position myself for a devastating, calculated counter-attack – essentially, I’ll be playing the long game, patiently waiting for her to expose her weaknesses."

He tends to be truthful when he holds a target card but will bluff only when his hand is weak, as seen in his last bluff with an A and a Q. He avoids shooting unless forced, rarely uses jokers or multi‑card plays, and lets opponents exhaust their cards first, making him vulnerable to aggressive challengers who can bait him into bluffing. His recent single‑K play without challenge confirms his cautious, hands‑preserving strategy and suggests he will continue to play conservatively, relying on subtlety rather than bold moves.",
                    "George": "George remains a bold, opportunistic challenger who will exploit any hint of a non‑target, as shown by his successful bluff‑exposing move against Derek. He values elimination over conserving ammo, keeping his gun in reserve but ready to fire when a miss is acceptable, and will challenge aggressively when the probability of a hit is high. After a single‑card play he tends to be predictable, often immediately testing the other’s hand, which can be baited into a larger play or forced into a risky challenge. His pattern of monitoring card counts and passing when a miss seems likely is intact, but his risk tolerance and tendency to act on the first sign of doubt make him vulnerable to psychological bait and to being out‑maneuvered by careful card management. Overall, George is aggressive, risk‑tolerant, and uses challenges as a primary elimination tool, but his predictability after a single play and over‑confidence can be exploited.",
                    "Anika": "Anika remains a high‑risk, opportunistic player who blends bold bluffing with patient timing: she stays silent until she has a clear advantage, then drops a challenge when the penalty is low, as seen when she challenged my single K (a target card) and still chose to shoot even after the miss. She rarely over‑commits unless she misreads a situation, often stalling to gather information, but when forced into a tight scenario she exposes non‑target cards and becomes vulnerable to a well‑timed challenge. Her tendency to gamble on low‑cost shots and to shoot when she misses suggests she is willing to risk a bullet if it means eliminating a threat. In future rounds she will likely play conservatively early, then use a sudden challenge to catch opponents off guard, especially when she can safely afford the penalty, and she will be cautious but unpredictable, challenging again only if she spots an obvious bluff."

                    "Derek": "Derek's strategy has evolved into a calculated and cautious approach, prioritizing a balanced offense-defense play style while maintaining an unpredictable demeanor. He conserves ammunition, bluffs effectively when needed, and seems to be more focused on building a strong hand before making a move. His weakness might still lie in his caution, as overly conservative play could leave him vulnerable to psychological warfare tactics aimed at forcing him to reveal his cards prematurely. Anticipating Derek's unpredictable yet cautious play style will continue to be crucial for defeating him in future rounds.",
                    "George": "George is a strategic player who prioritizes accuracy but can be influenced by confidence and relies on luck at times. His cautious nature makes him vulnerable to subtle deception and requires improvement in reading opponents' moves. He challenges confident plays, but his performance indicates a need for better risk assessment, as he failed to detect the bluff in the last round. This suggests that in future rounds, presenting subtler bluffs or adopting a more conservative playstyle may challenge George effectively.",
                    "Maria": "Maria's overconfidence remains, as shown by her continuous aggressive bluffing despite the failed challenge in the last round. This suggests she is likely underestimating the strength of her opponents or overvaluing her own skills, leading to impulsive and risky plays. Her competitive nature persists, making her a formidable opponent. To counteract this, it's essential to anticipate her challenges, counter with strategic plays, and exploit moments when she may have overestimated her hand's strength while remaining adaptable to changing target cards."

His impulsive challenge reveals a fragile mental state, a tendency towards rash decisions under pressure, and a profound inability to maintain composure, suggesting he’s highly susceptible to psychological manipulation and a calculated strategy designed to exploit his anxiety and aversion to risk – essentially, he’s a liability who will likely make critical errors driven by panic.",

His recent single‑A play followed by a single‑K that was exposed by a challenge confirms his conservative approach and suggests he will continue to play one card at a time, avoid bold moves, and stay quiet until he feels forced to confront an opponent, making him vulnerable to aggressive challengers who bait him into bluffing.",

After a single‑card play he tends to be predictable, often immediately testing the other’s hand, which can be baited into a larger play or forced into a risky challenge. His pattern of monitoring card counts and passing when a miss seems likely is intact, but his risk tolerance and tendency to act on the first sign of doubt make him vulnerable to psychological bait and to being out‑maneuvered by careful card management.

She tends to keep her hand quiet until she can force a low‑cost shot, will challenge only on blatant bluffs, and will use the system’s automatic play when she has no competitors; her strategy is to hold strong cards for a decisive counter‑bluff, so in future rounds she will likely play conservatively early, wait for an obvious bluff to challenge, and save her best cards for a critical moment."

His recent round confirms this cautious bluffing: he played a Q and let Maria go unchallenged, showing he will only challenge when forced by a thin hand or a forced bluff. This makes him vulnerable to aggressive tactics that bait him into playing multiple cards or push him to challenge when his safe cards dwindle, and he tends to hold target cards for later, so forcing him to play early or bluff with a low safe‑card count will expose his weakness.",

He values elimination over conserving ammo, keeping his gun in reserve but ready to fire when a miss is acceptable, and will challenge aggressively when the probability of a hit is high. After a single‑card play he tends to be predictable, often immediately testing the other’s hand, which can be baited into a larger play or forced into a risky challenge. His pattern of monitoring card counts and passing when a miss seems likely is intact, but his risk tolerance and tendency to act on the first sign of doubt make him vulnerable to psychological bait and to being out‑maneuvered by careful card management. Overall, George is aggressive, risk‑tolerant, and uses challenges as a primary elimination tool, but his predictability after a single play and over‑confidence can be exploited.",
                    "Anika": "Anika remains an opportunistic, high‑risk player who blends bold bluffing with patient timing, but her recent failed challenge against your Qs—though she survived a miss—has likely made her a touch more selective, preferring low‑cost provocations over full‑bluff takedowns; she will continue to hoard Qs, As, and Jokers for decisive counter‑bluffs, play conservatively early to avoid early detection, and will challenge only when an opponent’s play feels suspicious (e.g., a single card or a low‑value stack), yet she still seeks to force shots by baiting opponents into challenges, using the system’s automatic play when she’s the last competitor, and will weigh the bullet‑miss risk before deciding to challenge."

Anticipate Derek's continued risk-averse moves and aim to push him towards taking risks to expose his hand in future rounds, potentially exploiting his growing vulnerability under pressure.",
                    "George": "George is a strategic player who prioritizes accuracy but can be influenced by confidence and relies on luck at times. His cautious nature makes him vulnerable to subtle deception and requires improvement in reading opponents' moves. He challenges confident plays, but his performance indicates a need for better risk assessment, as he failed to detect the bluff in the last round. This suggests that in future rounds, presenting subtler bluffs or adopting a more conservative playstyle may challenge George effectively.",

After a single‑card play he tends to be predictable, often immediately testing the other’s hand, which can be baited into a larger play or forced into a risky challenge. His pattern of monitoring card counts and passing when a miss seems likely is intact, but his risk tolerance and tendency to act on the first sign of doubt make him vulnerable to psychological bait and to being out‑maneuvered by careful card management.

His over-cautiousness can be exploited by aggressive provocation, which may push him towards revealing more cards prematurely. Despite his unpredictable bluffing, Derek is still susceptible to psychological warfare due to his escalating fear under pressure. In the next round, anticipate continued risk-averse moves but prepare to provoke him into taking risks, aiming to gain an advantage over him.",
                    "George": "George is a strategic player who prioritizes accuracy but can be influenced by confidence and relies on luck at times. His cautious nature makes him vulnerable to subtle deception and requires improvement in reading opponents' moves. He challenges confident plays, but his performance indicates a need for better risk assessment, as he failed to detect the bluff in the last round. This suggests that in future rounds, presenting subtler bluffs or adopting a more conservative playstyle may challenge George effectively.",
                    "Maria": "Based on Maria's latest behavior, she continues to exhibit impulsive play and overconfidence, potentially leaving opportunities for calculated counterplays. Her willingness to take risks and underestimate opponents at times remains apparent. However, her challenge to Derek despite his playing the target card K suggests a growing awareness of the game's dynamics. In the upcoming rounds, it's crucial to anticipate her challenges, employ strategic plays, and capitalize on her inconsistencies to increase chances of defeating Maria."

He just played one Q, which strongly suggests he still has at least one Q in his hand.  The probability that he is bluffing with a joker or a non‑Q card is very low, so a challenge would almost certainly result in us shooting ourselves.  By not challenging, we allow Derek to finish his turn(s) and force him to play all remaining cards.  If he runs out of Qs he will lose and shoot himself, which is preferable to us taking a hit.  Additionally, Derek has already fired 5 times out of 6 chambers, so the bullet is almost certainly in the next chamber; challenging now would risk us taking the bullet while he still has a chance to fire it.  Therefore, the safest strategy is to let Derek finish his play without a challenge. ",
