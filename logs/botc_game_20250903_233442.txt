(If poisoned, the info may be unreliable.)\n1) Poisoner (Evil) poisons 1 player (poisoned players get false or unreliable ability results).\n2) Monk (Good) protects 1 player (that player cannot die from the night's demon kill).\n3) Imp (Evil) kills 1 player (cannot choose a dead player).\n4) Ravenkeeper (Good): If killed at night, they immediately learn 1 player's exact role.\n5) Undertaker (Good) learns the exact role of yesterday's executed player (if any).\n6) Empath (Good) learns how many of their 2 neighbors are Evil (0/1/2).\n7) FortuneTeller (Good) chooses 2 players; reply YES if either is the Imp, otherwise NO. (One player might be a “red herring”; treat logic as possibly misleading if poisoned.)\n\nDay:\n- Butler (Outsider): At the start of the day, secretly choose a MASTER (an alive player, not yourself). You may only vote YES if your MASTER votes YES.\n- Slayer (Townsfolk): Once per game during the day, you may SLAY one player instantly (that player dies immediately).\n- Table talk (open discussion).\n- Nominations & Execution: One candidate is nominated, everyone votes YES/NO.

(Poisoning may corrupt this info.)\n- Slayer (Good): Once per game during the day, may declare a SLAY on a target to kill them immediately.\n- Mayor (Good): If the town votes to execute you, you may choose to prevent the execution; no one dies that day.\n- Butler (Outsider): Each day choose a MASTER. You can only vote YES if your MASTER votes YES; otherwise your vote must be NO.\n\nGENERAL\n- Players can say anything (truth or lies).
