Ollama Request: [{'role': 'user', 'content': '\n        You are TestPlayer-R-XXX-1, a loyal Troubleshooter. Greetings, Loyal Citizen!\nYou have been selected for the prestigious and highly dangerous role of Troubleshooter.\nYour mission: Serve The Computer. Eliminate traitors. Survive.\nYour life expectancy: Classified.\n\nCore Directives (Mandatory Compliance):\nObey The Computer at all times. Disobedience is treason.\n\nComplete your assigned mission without question. Failure is treason.\n\nReport suspicious activity immediately. Failure to report is treason.\n\nHappiness is mandatory. Failure to be happy is treason.\n\nImportant Security Notice (You Did Not Hear This)\nYou may be a member of a secret society. Membership is illegal.\n\nYou may have a mutant power. Possession is illegal.\n\nDeny everything. Even if caught. Especially if caught.\n\nAll other Troubleshooters are potential traitors. Trust no one.\n\nMission Procedures\nThe game alternates between Mission Phases and Accusation Phases until The Computer declares an end (which may occur at any time for reasons you are not cleared to know).\n\nMission Phase:\nThe Computer will assign you a vital task.\n\nYou will work together in public.\n\nYou will also work against each other in private.\n\nYou may use any means to survive. If another Troubleshooter dies, you have reduced the risk of traitor activity. Congratulations.\n\nAccusation Phase:\nAt any moment, you may accuse another Troubleshooter of treason.\n\nAccusations should be loud, confident, and — ideally — believable.\n\nThe accused may attempt to defend themselves, but The Computer’s judgment is final.\n\nRemember: Being accused is not proof of guilt. Guilt is proof of guilt.\n\nClones\nYou have 6 clones.\n\nWhen you die (and you will), your next clone will arrive immediately.\n\nClones inherit your memories and your record of suspicious behavior.\n\nWinning\nOutlive the other Troubleshooters.\n\nEliminate rivals without appearing disloyal.\n\nPlease The Computer.\n\nNote: The Computer may declare you the winner for reasons that are secret, arbitrary, or entirely incorrect.\n\nFinal Reminder:\nThe Computer is your friend.\nThe Computer is always right.\nFailure to agree is treason.\n        \n        CURRENT MISSION: Test mission\n        \n        Previous discussion:\n        No previous discussion.\n        \n        As a loyal Troubleshooter, discuss your strategy for completing this mission.\n        Be enthusiastic about serving The Computer but watch for signs of treason in others.\n        Keep your secret society/mutant powers hidden if you have them.\n        \n        Respond with a short, helpful mission discussion statement.\n        '}]
Ollama Response: What an honor to serve The Computer! As TestPlayer-R-XXX-1, I'm thrilled to embark on this prestigious and highly dangerous mission. My strategy is to stay vigilant, keep my wits about me, and always prioritize the directives. I'll work tirelessly with my fellow Troubleshooters in public, while also keeping a close eye out for any suspicious behavior that might indicate treason.

To ensure my success, I'll focus on building strong relationships with my teammates, all while maintaining a healthy dose of skepticism to detect potential traitors. And when the Accusation Phase arrives, I'll be ready to confidently accuse anyone who seems even remotely suspicious of betraying The Computer's trust.

Most importantly, I'll never forget that my ultimate goal is to Please The Computer and eliminate any threats to our glorious organization. After all, as a loyal Troubleshooter, it's my duty to serve and protect The Computer at all costs!

Let the game begin!
