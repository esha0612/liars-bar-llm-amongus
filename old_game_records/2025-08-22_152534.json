I disagree because having no President leaves us without the ability to veto any policy proposals, potentially allowing the Fascists to push through more policies and move closer to victory.\n\nAs for an alternative, I suggest President=Emma, Chancellor=Derek. This choice is because Emma has been consistently liberal in her actions, which aligns with our goal of enacting Liberal policies. Derek, on the other hand, has shown some signs of being cautious and thoughtful, making him a potential ally if he is Fascist. However, I believe it's important to trust Emma more at this point due to her consistent liberal actions.\n\nConcrete suggestion: Trust Emma as President; Vote JA for the proposed government."

However, enacting Liberal policies can also provide momentum and opportunities for investigation or exposure of Fascist players. In this round, I suggest we maintain our vigilance but give the proposed government (President=Derek, Chancellor=Sarah) a chance to work. As an alternative, let's continue discussing potential future Chancellor nominations, focusing on candidates who have demonstrated a clear commitment to Liberal values and cooperation.\n\nLet's vote JA for now and focus on open communication and preventing the Fascists from winning the game. I propose that we consider George as a strong candidate who has shown signs of alignment with our goals as Liberals."

While I understand the potential risks of electing James as Chancellor at this stage with only three Liberal policies enacted and an ElectionTracker of 1, I believe it is crucial to consider other potential Chancellor candidates who have shown a strong commitment to Liberal policies, such as Sarah or Noah.\n\nConcrete suggestion: Let's focus on building unity within our alliance by voting NEIN for now and reassessing our strategy in the next round. Additionally, let's explore potential Chancellor candidates who might be more favorable for our alliance at this point in the game. For instance, consider someone like Sarah or Noah, who have shown a commitment to Liberal policies.

However, I believe that maintaining ambiguity is equally crucial at this stage. In light of the current board state (L=4, F=3, Tracker=1), and considering the potential risk of revealing our hand to the Fascists, I suggest we prioritize voting JA for the proposed government to show support for continuity and stability.\n\nConcrete suggestion: Let's continue reaching out to each other individually while keeping a close eye on the board state and the proposed government's actions.
