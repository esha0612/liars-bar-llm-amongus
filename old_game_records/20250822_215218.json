Their poker face remained unreadable during the challenge, making it difficult to gauge their bluffing abilities. This suggests a calculated and reserved approach, possibly with a tendency towards conservative plays. It's worth noting that they may possess a strong understanding of the game, as indicated by their survival in the first round without revealing their hand.
