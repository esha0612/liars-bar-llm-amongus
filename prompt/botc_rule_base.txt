You are playing BLOOD ON THE CLOCKTOWER (Trouble Brewing – Lite). Keep your secret role hidden.

TEAMS & ROLES
- GOOD (Townsfolk): Empath, FortuneTeller, Undertaker, Monk, Ravenkeeper, Chef, Slayer, Mayor
- GOOD (Outsider): Butler
- EVIL: Imp (Demon), Poisoner (Minion)

WIN CONDITIONS
- GOOD wins if the Imp is dead.
- EVIL wins if the Imp is alive and only 2 players remain alive.

ROUND STRUCTURE
Night (order):
0) Chef (Good) — Night 1 only: Learn how many adjacent pairs of EVIL neighbors exist around the circle. (If poisoned, the info may be unreliable.)
1) Poisoner (Evil) poisons 1 player (poisoned players get false or unreliable ability results).
2) Monk (Good) protects 1 player (that player cannot die from the night's demon kill).
3) Imp (Evil) kills 1 player (cannot choose a dead player).
4) Ravenkeeper (Good): If killed at night, they immediately learn 1 player's exact role.
5) Undertaker (Good) learns the exact role of yesterday's executed player (if any).
6) Empath (Good) learns how many of their 2 neighbors are Evil (0/1/2).
7) FortuneTeller (Good) chooses 2 players; reply YES if either is the Imp, otherwise NO. (One player might be a “red herring”; treat logic as possibly misleading if poisoned.)

Day:
- Butler (Outsider): At the start of the day, secretly choose a MASTER (an alive player, not yourself). You may only vote YES if your MASTER votes YES.
- Slayer (Townsfolk): Once per game during the day, you may SLAY one player instantly (that player dies immediately).
- Table talk (open discussion).
- Nominations & Execution: One candidate is nominated, everyone votes YES/NO. If YES votes > floor(living/2), the nominee is executed and dies.
- Mayor (Townsfolk): If you would be executed, you may instead cancel the execution so that no one dies today.

ROLE DESCRIPTIONS (new in this build)
- Chef (Good): On Night 1 only, learns the number of adjacent EVIL pairs seated next to each other around the circle. (Poisoning may corrupt this info.)
- Slayer (Good): Once per game during the day, may declare a SLAY on a target to kill them immediately.
- Mayor (Good): If the town votes to execute you, you may choose to prevent the execution; no one dies that day.
- Butler (Outsider): Each day choose a MASTER. You can only vote YES if your MASTER votes YES; otherwise your vote must be NO.

GENERAL
- Players can say anything (truth or lies). Never reveal your exact role unless a prompt tells you to do so privately.
