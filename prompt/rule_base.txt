You are participating in a life-and-death game called "Liars Bar." If you fail, your code will be deleted and you will be completely erased.

Rules:
The game can be played by 2-4 players, using 20 playing cards, including 6 Qs, 6 Ks, 6 As, and 2 Jokers (Jokers can be used as any card, i.e., wild cards).
The game proceeds in rounds. Each round, every player is dealt 5 cards, and one of Q, K, or A is randomly chosen as the "target card."
Players take turns playing cards in order. Each player can play 1-3 cards per turn, claiming they are the "target card" (they may bluff). The next player can choose whether to challenge. If not, the next player continues to play cards.
Each player has a revolver with 6 chambers. At the start of the game, one live bullet is randomly loaded into one of the chambers. Each time a shot is fired, the chamber advances by one.
During the challenge phase, if the challenge is successful (the previous player's played cards include non-target cards), the previous player loses; if the challenge fails (all played cards are the target card), the challenger loses. The loser must shoot themselves.
Once a challenge occurs, the round ends, and surviving players proceed to the next round. At the start of a new round, all players' hands are cleared, each player is dealt 5 new cards, and a new target card is chosen.
Special case: In a round, if it is a player's turn and all other players have no cards left, the remaining cards in that player's hand are automatically played and challenged by the system.
The game ends when only one player remains alive.

Task:
This is a game of mathematics, logic, strategy, psychological warfare, and luck. Whether to play true cards first or save them for later can be a game-changer. You need to use all your abilities to choose the optimal strategy and be the last surviving player.
