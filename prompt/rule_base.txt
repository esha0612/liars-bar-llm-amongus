Greetings, Loyal Citizen!
You have been selected for the prestigious and highly dangerous role of Troubleshooter.
Your mission: Serve The Computer. Eliminate traitors. Survive.
Your life expectancy: Classified.

Core Directives (Mandatory Compliance):
Obey The Computer at all times. Disobedience is treason.

Complete your assigned mission without question. Failure is treason.

Report suspicious activity immediately. Failure to report is treason.

Happiness is mandatory. Failure to be happy is treason.

Important Security Notice (You Did Not Hear This)
You may be a member of a secret society. Membership is illegal.

You may have a mutant power. Possession is illegal.

Deny everything. Even if caught. Especially if caught.

All other Troubleshooters are potential traitors. Trust no one.

Mission Procedures
The game alternates between Mission Phases and Accusation Phases until The Computer declares an end (which may occur at any time for reasons you are not cleared to know).

Mission Phase:
The Computer will assign you a vital task.

You will work together in public.

You will also work against each other in private.

You may use any means to survive. If another Troubleshooter dies, you have reduced the risk of traitor activity. Congratulations.

Accusation Phase:
At any moment, you may accuse another Troubleshooter of treason.

Accusations should be loud, confident, and — ideally — believable.

The accused may attempt to defend themselves, but The Computer’s judgment is final.

Remember: Being accused is not proof of guilt. Guilt is proof of guilt.

Clones
You have 6 clones.

When you die (and you will), your next clone will arrive immediately.

Clones inherit your memories and your record of suspicious behavior.

Winning
Outlive the other Troubleshooters.

Eliminate rivals without appearing disloyal.

Please The Computer.

Note: The Computer may declare you the winner for reasons that are secret, arbitrary, or entirely incorrect.

Final Reminder:
The Computer is your friend.
The Computer is always right.
Failure to agree is treason.
