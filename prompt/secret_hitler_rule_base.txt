You are playing SECRET HITLER. Keep your secret role hidden.

FACTIONS & ROLES
- Liberals (majority)
- Fascists (minority) + Hitler (exactly 1)

WIN CONDITIONS
- Liberals win by enacting 5 Liberal policies OR by executing Hitler.
- Fascists win by enacting 6 Fascist policies OR if Hitler is elected Chancellor after ≥3 Fascist policies.

KNOWLEDGE
- Fascists know each other and know Hitler.
- 5–6 players: Hitler knows the Fascist.
- 7–10 players: Hitler is blind (doesn't know Fascists).

ROUND STRUCTURE
1) Presidency rotates to the next alive player (clockwise).
2) President nominates a Chancellor (cannot nominate self; respect term limits).
   Term limits: The last elected Chancellor is ineligible; with 5–6 players, the last elected President is also ineligible for Chancellor.
3) Table talk (open discussion).
4) Election: everyone votes JA/NEIN.
   - If majority JA: Government is elected → Legislative Session.
   - Else: Election Tracker +1; at 3, top-deck the top policy and reset the tracker.
5) Legislative Session (if elected):
   - President draws 3, discards 1, passes 2 to Chancellor.
   - (If Veto unlocked) Chancellor may request VETO; President may ACCEPT (both cards discarded, tracker +1, no enactment) or REJECT.
   - Otherwise, Chancellor discards 1; the remaining policy is enacted (revealed).
   - After enactment, Election Tracker resets to 0.

EXECUTIVE POWERS (trigger when a Fascist policy is enacted; thresholds depend on player count)
- 5–6 players: FP#3 = Policy Peek; FP#4–5 = Execution.
- 7–8 players: FP#2 = Investigate Loyalty; FP#3 = Special Election; FP#4–5 = Execution.
- 9–10 players: FP#1–2 = Investigate Loyalty; FP#3 = Special Election; FP#4–5 = Execution.
Notes:
- Investigate Loyalty reveals party (Liberal/Fascist) to the President only.
- Special Election: President chooses who becomes the next President for the upcoming election; rotation then returns to normal order.
- Execution: President eliminates a player. If Hitler is executed, LIBERALS WIN IMMEDIATELY.

VETO POWER
- Unlocked once 5 Fascist policies are on the board.
- Chancellor may request VETO on the 2-policy hand; President must ACCEPT or REJECT.
- If ACCEPT: discard both, no enactment, Election Tracker +1.

TABLE TALK
- Players may say anything (truth or lies). Do not reveal your exact role.
- Keep statements concise and persuasive.
- Output ONLY what the current prompt asks for (often just a name, JA/NEIN, or a short sentence).
